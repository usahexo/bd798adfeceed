They may contain harmful bacteria, viruses, or toxins that can make you sick. Some common symptoms of food poisoning include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. In some cases, food poisoning can be fatal.</p>
<p>It is important to take steps to protect yourself from food poisoning by cooking food properly and washing your hands thoroughly. You should also avoid eating foods that are likely to contain harmful bacteria, such as unpasteurized milk and raw meat. If you think you may have eaten something that made you sick, see a doctor right away.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-responsible-for-ensuring-food-safety"><a href="#Who-is-responsible-for-ensuring-food-safety" class="headerlink" title="Who is responsible for ensuring food safety?"></a>Who is responsible for ensuring food safety?</h1><p>The responsibility for ensuring food safety falls on a variety of different people and organizations depending on the type of food. For example, the USDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, and eggs, while the FDA is responsible for all other types of food. In general, the producers and processors of food are responsible for following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) which are designed to minimize the risk of contamination. However, consumers also have a role to play in keeping themselves safe by washing their hands and cooking food properly.</p>
<p>Despite these measures, there are sometimes outbreaks of foodborne illness that can be traced back to a problem with the production or handling of food. When this happens, the FDA or USDA will investigate and take action to ensure that the affected product is removed from store shelves and that steps are taken to prevent future outbreaks.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-food-safety-be-compromised"><a href="#How-can-food-safety-be-compromised" class="headerlink" title="How can food safety be compromised?"></a>How can food safety be compromised?</h1><p>There are many ways in which food safety can be compromised. One way is if the food is not stored or handled correctly. Foods that are not stored at the correct temperature can become contaminated with bacteria, which can make people sick. Food that is not handled correctly can also become contaminated with bacteria. For example, if someone who is sick with a stomach virus coughs or sneezes on food, the virus can contaminate the food and make people sick.</p>
<p>Another way that food safety can be compromised is if the food is not cooked properly. Raw meat and poultry can contain bacteria that can cause illness if they are not cooked properly. Raw eggs can also contain a harmful bacterium called salmonella. Salmonella can cause serious illness, especially in young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>Foods that are past their expiration date or have been mishandled can also pose a risk for food poisoning. Expired foods may contain harmful toxins that can make people sick. And foods that have been mishandled may have been exposed to dangerous bacteria that can cause illness.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that there are many safe and healthy ways to prepare and store food. By following some simple guidelines, you can help protect yourself and your family from foodborne illnesses.</p>
